      <p>Melody of Hope is a non-profit for the non-profits. The heart behind this organization is to be instrumental in supporting other organizations' causes, by raising funds and awareness through musical performing arts. Melody of Hope achieves this by hosting benefit concerts, music, festivals, and other events in which 100% of the proceeds are donated to partnering charities. Through these events, Melody of Hope is able to become an ambassador of these non-profit organizations and provide artists a stage to display their talents.

      Put simply, Melody of Hope unites passionate audiences with compassionate organizations to affect change in local communities.
